  "summary": "The implementation appears to address all six requirements from the BuildRequest. The InvestmentForm component now includes the e-project dropdown with 38 secoinfi-apps options, the Mode select with exactly four payment options, two transaction ID fields (numeric required and optional text), and a payment notice section displaying UPI, WhatsApp, and Ethereum information. The backend Investment type and createInvestment function have been updated to accept and store the new fields. However, verification of REQ-5 (ensuring form visibility to all users without admin-only restrictions) cannot be fully confirmed from the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states in non-goals: 'Modifying the transaction form or transaction creation flow' and does not request any data migration functionality. The migration.mo file with its OldInvestment/NewInvestment types and migration logic was not requested.",
